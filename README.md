# Machine Learning App

This project is a **Machine Learning application** that consists of two parts:

1. A **Python backend** using **Flask** to serve a machine learning model via an API.
2. A **Next.js frontend** for interacting with the model.

Follow the steps below to set up and run both parts of the project.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up the Python Backend (Flask)

1. **Navigate to the Python project folder**:
   Open a terminal and go to the directory where your Python project is located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/python/project

   ```

2. Then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Test the API**:
   You can test the API using tools like `rest.http`. that is attached with the project but you should have rest client installed in your vscode
